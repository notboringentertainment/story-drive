# Epic 1.5 Scrum Master Refinements

**Date:** 2025-09-21
**Prepared by:** Bob (Scrum Master Agent)
**Subject:** Epic 1.5 Refinements and Risk Mitigation

## Executive Summary

Reviewed PM's Epic 1.5 conversion and implemented critical refinements to ensure successful delivery. Added technical spike, split oversized stories, mandated design sprint, and added 20% buffer to estimates.

## Key Refinements Made

### 1. Added Story 1.5.0: Storage Strategy Technical Spike
- **Why:** localStorage limitations (5-10MB) insufficient for professional documents
- **Effort:** 2-4 hours
- **Must complete before:** Any development begins
- **Deliverables:** POC implementations, benchmarks, migration strategy

### 2. Split Large Stories Into Basic/Advanced
- **Story 1.5.2 Screenplay:** Split into 1.5.2a (Basic, 4-5hr) and 1.5.2b (Advanced, 4-5hr)
- **Story 1.5.3 Novel:** Split into 1.5.3a (Basic, 4-5hr) and 1.5.3b (Advanced, 4-5hr)
- **Benefit:** More manageable chunks, can deliver value incrementally

### 3. Mandated Design Sprint
- **Duration:** 1 week before development
- **Required Deliverables:**
  - UI/UX mockups for all modes
  - Interaction patterns documentation
  - Visual design system
  - Responsive breakpoints
  - Accessibility standards
  - User flow diagrams

### 4. Revised Effort Estimates with Buffer
- **Original Epic Estimate:** 34-44 hours
- **Revised Epic Estimate:** 40-52 hours (with spike and splits)
- **With 20% Buffer:** 48-62 hours
- **Timeline:** 4 weeks total (1 design, 3 development)

## Updated Story List

| Story | Title | Priority | Original Effort | New Effort |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------------|------------|
| 1.5.0 | Storage Spike | P0 | N/A | 2-4 hrs |
| 1.5.1 | Core Infrastructure | P0 | 4-6 hrs | 4-6 hrs |
| 1.5.2a | Screenplay Basic | P1 | 8-10 hrs | 4-5 hrs |
| 1.5.2b | Screenplay Advanced | P2 | (included) | 4-5 hrs |
| 1.5.3a | Novel Basic | P1 | 8-10 hrs | 4-5 hrs |
| 1.5.3b | Novel Advanced | P2 | (included) | 4-5 hrs |
| 1.5.4 | Outline Mode | P2 | 6-8 hrs | 6-8 hrs |
| 1.5.5 | Story Bible | P2 | 8-10 hrs | 8-10 hrs |

## Sprint Plan (Revised)

### Sprint 0: Design & Research
- Complete design sprint deliverables
- Execute Story 1.5.0 (Storage Spike)
- Prepare development environment

### Sprint 1: Foundation (13-16 hrs)
- Story 1.5.1: Mode Infrastructure
- Story 1.5.2a: Screenplay Basic
- Story 1.5.3a: Novel Basic

### Sprint 2: Enhancements (12-15 hrs)
- Story 1.5.2b: Screenplay Advanced
- Story 1.5.3b: Novel Advanced
- Begin Story 1.5.4: Outline Mode

### Sprint 3: Completion (14-18 hrs)
- Complete Story 1.5.4: Outline Mode
- Story 1.5.5: Story Bible Mode
- Integration testing & bug fixes

## Risk Mitigation Improvements

### Technical Risks
1. **Storage Limits:** Addressed with Story 1.5.0 spike
2. **Large Story Sizes:** Mitigated by splitting into basic/advanced
3. **Missing Designs:** Prevented with mandatory design sprint
4. **Underestimation:** Handled with 20% buffer

### Process Risks
1. **Blocked Development:** Design sprint completes before coding
2. **Scope Creep:** Basic/advanced split creates clear MVP boundaries
3. **Integration Issues:** Each story now properly sized for testing

## Definition of Done Updates

Each story must meet:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria satisfied
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Design specifications followed
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] No regression in existing features

## Recommendations for Team

### Immediate Actions
1. Schedule design sprint with UX team
2. Assign developer to Story 1.5.0 spike
3. Update project board with new stories
4. Communicate timeline to stakeholders

### Development Guidelines
1. Complete stories in priority order
2. No story should exceed 6 hours without review
3. Basic features must work before starting advanced
4. Daily standups to track epic progress
5. Demo each completed story to team

## Quality Gates

Before marking Epic complete:
1. All 8 stories accepted by PO
2. End-to-end testing across all modes
3. Performance testing with large documents
4. User acceptance testing
5. Documentation review
6. Rollback plan tested

## Success Metrics (Updated)

1. Each mode delivers MVP functionality on schedule
2. No critical bugs in production
3. Mode switching works seamlessly
4. Storage solution handles 50MB+ documents
5. User satisfaction score > 8/10
6. < 3% increase in support tickets

## Conclusion

These refinements transform Epic 1.5 from a high-risk endeavor into a manageable, incremental delivery plan. The combination of technical spike, design sprint, story splitting, and buffer time significantly increases probability of success.

**Epic Status:** Ready for sprint planning with refinements
