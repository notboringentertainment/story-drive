# Epic 2: Cross-Agent Memory System - Dev Handoff Complete

## ðŸŽ‰ Epic 2 COMPLETE
**Dev Agent**: James
**Stories Completed**: ALL 5 (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5)
**Status**: âœ… Ready for Production

## Implementation Summary

### Story 2.1: SessionMemoryStore âœ…
**Purpose**: Centralized conversation storage
- Session-based memory with configurable TTL
- Thread-safe operations with async locking
- FIFO eviction when limits reached
- Automatic cleanup of expired sessions

### Story 2.2: Memory API Endpoints âœ…
**Purpose**: REST API for memory operations
- 6 endpoints: conversations, context, stats
- Pagination support for large histories
- Frontend MemoryService for integration
- Full CRUD operations on memory

### Story 2.3: Context Injection System âœ…
**Purpose**: Smart cross-agent context awareness
- 4-factor relevance scoring (keywords, semantics, recency, relationships)
- Agent relationship matrix for prioritization
- Token limit management per agent
- Automatic injection into prompts

### Story 2.4: UI Chat Window Management âœ…
**Purpose**: Clean visual separation between agents
- Chat clears on agent switch with smooth transitions
- Conversation preservation in memory
- Loading states and agent headers
- Context summaries from other agents

### Story 2.5: Context-Aware Responses âœ…
**Purpose**: Natural context integration
- Combines document context (Story 1.4) with cross-agent context
- Natural attribution phrases
- Relevance filtering (0.5 threshold)
- Response quality metrics
- No forced context on unrelated queries

## Key Files Created/Modified

### New Components
- `src/services/SessionMemoryStore.js` - Memory storage
- `src/services/ContextInjector.js` - Context selection
- `src/services/ResponseEnhancer.js` - Natural responses
- `src/routes/memoryRoutes.js` - API endpoints
- `public/services/MemoryService.js` - Frontend service
- `public/js/ChatWindowManager.js` - UI management
- `public/index-enhanced.html` - Updated UI

### Modified Components
- `src/ContextAwareAgent.js` - Enhanced with ResponseEnhancer
- `server.js` - Integrated all new services

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests
- SessionMemoryStore: 15 tests âœ…
- ContextInjector: 15 tests âœ…

### Integration Tests
- `test-memory-integration.js` âœ…
- `test-memory-api.js` âœ…
- `test-context-injection.js` âœ…
- `test-response-enhancement.js` âœ…

## Performance Metrics
- Context retrieval: < 200ms
- Response generation: < 3 seconds
- Memory operations: < 50ms
- UI transitions: 300ms smooth

## How to Use

### Access Enhanced UI
```
http://localhost:3001/index-enhanced.html
```

### Test Cross-Agent Memory
1. Chat with Plot Architect about a story idea
2. Switch to Character Psychologist
3. Ask related question - agent will reference previous context
4. Switch to Dialogue Coach
5. Observe natural building on both previous conversations

## Next Steps

### For Product Team
- Epic 2 ready for user testing
- Monitor memory usage in production
- Gather feedback on context relevance

### For Next Developer
- Consider implementing:
  - Memory export/import
  - Context summarization for long sessions
  - User control over context sharing
  - Analytics on context usage

### For Story Manager (Bob)
- Epic 2 complete, ready for:
  - Epic 3 planning
  - Performance optimization stories
  - Advanced features backlog

## Success Criteria Met
âœ… Agents share context naturally
âœ… UI provides clean separation
âœ… Context is relevant, not forced
âœ… Performance under 3 seconds
âœ… Document + agent context combined
âœ… System maintains agent personalities

## Notes
- Session memory clears after 24 hours (configurable)
- Max 100 messages per session (configurable)
- Context injection can be disabled per agent
- All original agent personas preserved
