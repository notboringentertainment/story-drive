# Story 1.5.0: Storage Strategy Technical Spike

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** to investigate and determine the optimal storage strategy for multi-mode professional documents,
**so that** we can handle large documents (>10MB) without hitting localStorage limits and ensure data integrity across mode switches

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Research and document localStorage vs IndexedDB performance characteristics for documents 1KB to 50MB
2. Create proof-of-concept implementations for both storage approaches
3. Benchmark mode switching performance with sample documents (100KB, 1MB, 5MB, 10MB)
4. Document migration strategy from current localStorage to recommended solution
5. Provide recommendation with pros/cons for each approach
6. Define data schema that supports versioning and backward compatibility
7. Test concurrent access patterns (multiple tabs/windows)
8. Validate storage works offline and syncs when online (if applicable)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Research Phase (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Document localStorage limitations (5-10MB typical)
  - [ ] Research IndexedDB capabilities and browser support
  - [ ] Investigate hybrid approaches (metadata in localStorage, content in IndexedDB)
  - [ ] Review how competitor apps handle storage (Scrivener web, Google Docs, etc.)

- [ ] Proof of Concept Implementation (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create localStorage adapter with compression
  - [ ] Create IndexedDB adapter with same interface
  - [ ] Implement storage interface abstraction
  - [ ] Build test harness for benchmarking

- [ ] Performance Testing (AC: 3, 7)
  - [ ] Generate test documents of various sizes
  - [ ] Measure save/load times for each storage method
  - [ ] Test mode switching performance
  - [ ] Test multiple tab scenarios

- [ ] Schema Design (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Define versioned schema structure
  - [ ] Create migration utilities
  - [ ] Document upgrade/downgrade paths

- [ ] Documentation (AC: 4, 5)
  - [ ] Write migration guide from localStorage
  - [ ] Create decision matrix with recommendations
  - [ ] Document API design for storage layer

## Dev Notes

### Current Storage Implementation
- Currently using localStorage in `src/services/storage.ts`
- Auto-save functionality in `src/services/autosave.ts`
- Document state managed in `src/stores/documentStore.ts`

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests in `src/__tests__/services/`
- Use Vitest framework
- Mock storage APIs for unit tests
- Integration tests for actual browser storage
- Performance benchmarks in separate test suite

### Technical Considerations
- localStorage sync but limited to ~5-10MB
- IndexedDB async but virtually unlimited (50% of free disk)
- Need to maintain backward compatibility with existing localStorage data
- Consider compression (LZ-string or similar) for localStorage approach
- Mode-specific data might need separate storage strategy

### Browser Compatibility Requirements
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+
