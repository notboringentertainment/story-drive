# Epic 1.5 Creation - Scrum Master Review Document

**Date:** 2025-09-21
**Prepared by:** John (Product Manager Agent)
**Subject:** Story 1.5 Conversion to Epic 1.5

## Executive Summary

Converted initial Story 1.5 (Document Format Switching) into Epic 1.5 (Professional Writing Modes) after scope analysis revealed ~34-44 hours of work. Created 5 properly scoped stories following brownfield development patterns.

## Initial Request

User requested creation of Story 1.5 with the following requirement:
- Multi-format writing tool with mode switching between Screenplay, Novel, Outline, and Story Bible formats
- Each mode to replicate professional industry-standard applications (Final Draft, Scrivener/Ulysses, WorkFlowy, World Anvil)

## Scope Analysis & Decision

### Initial Assessment
- Original request positioned as single story
- Detailed analysis revealed each mode essentially constitutes a mini-application
- Total scope: 34-44 hours of development work
- Far exceeds single story capacity (4-6 hours)

### Conversion Rationale
- **Complexity:** Each mode requires distinct UI/UX transformation
- **Feature Depth:** Professional-grade functionality per mode
- **Risk Management:** Breaking into stories allows incremental delivery
- **Dependencies:** Clear sequencing with infrastructure story first

## Epic Structure Created

### Epic 1.5: Professional Writing Modes
**File:** `epic-1.5-professional-writing-modes.md`

**Goal:** Transform single-format editor into multi-mode professional writing environment

**Stories Breakdown:**

| Story | Title | Priority | Effort | Purpose |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| 1.5.1 | Core Mode Infrastructure | P0 | 4-6 hrs | Foundation for all modes |
| 1.5.2 | Screenplay Mode | P1 | 8-10 hrs | Final Draft-like features |
| 1.5.3 | Novel Mode | P1 | 8-10 hrs | Scrivener/Ulysses-like features |
| 1.5.4 | Outline Mode | P2 | 6-8 hrs | WorkFlowy-like features |
| 1.5.5 | Story Bible Mode | P2 | 8-10 hrs | World Anvil-like features |

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `/docs/stories/epic-1.5-professional-writing-modes.md` - Epic overview with architecture
2. `/docs/stories/story-1.5.1-core-mode-infrastructure.md` - Foundation story
3. `/docs/stories/story-1.5.2-screenplay-mode.md` - Screenplay implementation
4. `/docs/stories/story-1.5.3-novel-mode.md` - Novel implementation
5. `/docs/stories/story-1.5.4-outline-mode.md` - Outline implementation
6. `/docs/stories/story-1.5.5-story-bible-mode.md` - Story Bible implementation

### Modified Files
1. `/docs/stories/story-1.5-document-format-switching.md` - Added conversion notice

## Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture Pattern
- Modular mode system with registration pattern
- Mode Manager singleton for coordination
- TipTap remains core editing engine across all modes
- CSS class-based UI transformations

### Data Structure
- Versioned localStorage schema for backward compatibility
- Mode-specific metadata storage
- Content adapter pattern for cross-mode conversion

### Dependencies
- Story 1.5.1 must complete first (infrastructure)
- Stories 1.5.2-1.5.5 can proceed in parallel after 1.5.1
- Builds on existing Stories 1.1 (TipTap) and 1.3 (Auto-save)

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Scope Creep** - Each mode could expand infinitely
   - Mitigation: MVP feature sets defined per mode

2. **Data Loss** - Complex mode switching could lose content
   - Mitigation: Content adapter with preview/warnings

3. **Performance** - Large documents across modes
   - Mitigation: Debouncing, virtual scrolling, lazy loading

### Rollback Strategy
- Each mode can be feature-flagged independently
- Mode selector can be hidden if critical issues arise
- Default to basic editor mode as fallback

## Acceptance Criteria Highlights

### Per Mode
- **Screenplay:** Auto-formatting, TAB navigation, industry margins
- **Novel:** Chapter organization, word count tracking, focus modes
- **Outline:** Infinite nesting, drag-drop, zoom functionality
- **Story Bible:** Templates, relationships, wiki-links

### Cross-Mode
- Content preservation during switches
- Mode state persistence in localStorage
- Performance benchmarks (< 500ms switch time)

## Recommendations for Sprint Planning

### Sprint 1 (Foundation)
- Complete Story 1.5.1 (Mode Infrastructure)
- Sets up framework for all subsequent work

### Sprint 2-3 (Core Modes)
- Story 1.5.2 (Screenplay) and 1.5.3 (Novel)
- Delivers primary writing modes

### Sprint 4 (Extended Modes)
- Story 1.5.4 (Outline) and 1.5.5 (Story Bible)
- Adds planning and worldbuilding capabilities

## Success Metrics

1. Each mode provides authentic professional tool experience
2. Mode switching without data loss
3. < 500ms mode switch time
4. No regression in existing Stories 1.1-1.4 features
5. All acceptance criteria met per story

## Questions for Scrum Master

1. Should we adjust priority of modes based on user feedback?
2. Can Stories 1.5.2-1.5.5 be assigned to different developers after 1.5.1?
3. Should we create a spike for IndexedDB investigation (localStorage limits)?
4. Do we need design mockups before development begins?

## Appendix: Story Effort Comparison

| Story | Original Estimate | Epic Breakdown |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| 1.5 (original) | 4-6 hours | Not feasible |
| 1.5 (as epic) | 34-44 hours | Properly scoped |
| Average story | 4-8 hours | Achievable |

## Conclusion

The conversion from Story 1.5 to Epic 1.5 properly reflects the scope and complexity of creating a professional multi-mode writing environment. Each story is now actionable, testable, and deliverable within reasonable sprint boundaries.

**Status:** Ready for sprint planning and assignment
