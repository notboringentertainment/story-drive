# Story 2.4: UI Chat Window Management

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the chat window to clear when I switch agents while maintaining conversation context,
**so that** I have a clean visual separation between different agent conversations

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Chat window clears completely when switching to a different agent
2. Previous agent's conversation is preserved in memory (not lost)
3. Switching back to a previous agent restores that agent's conversation history
4. Visual transition indicates agent switch (fade, slide, or similar)
5. Loading indicator shows while fetching agent context
6. Current agent indicator is prominently displayed in chat header
7. Option to view "conversation summary" from other agents
8. Smooth performance with no UI freezing during switch

## Dev Notes

### Component Structure
```
ChatContainer/
  ├── ChatHeader.jsx       // Agent info display
  ├── ChatWindow.jsx       // Message display area
  ├── ChatInput.jsx        // User input field
  ├── AgentSwitcher.jsx    // Agent selection UI
  └── ConversationSummary.jsx // Other agents' context
```

### State Structure
```javascript
{
  activeAgentId: 'plot-architect',
  conversations: {
    'plot-architect': [...messages],
    'character-psychologist': [...messages],
    'dialogue-coach': [...messages]
  },
  isLoading: false,
  isSwitching: false,
  summaries: {
    'plot-architect': 'Discussed space adventure...',
    'character-psychologist': 'Developed trust issues character...'
  }
}
```

### Agent Switch Flow
1. User clicks new agent
2. Set `isSwitching: true`
3. Save current conversation to state
4. Trigger fade-out animation
5. Clear chat window DOM
6. Fetch new agent context
7. Load agent's previous conversation (if any)
8. Trigger fade-in animation
9. Set `isSwitching: false`

### Visual Transition CSS
```css
.chat-window {
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;
}
.chat-window.switching {
  opacity: 0;
}
.chat-window.active {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

### Performance Considerations
- Limit stored messages per agent (e.g., last 100)
- Lazy load older messages on scroll
- Use windowing for very long conversations
- Cache rendered messages with React.memo

### Accessibility Requirements
- Announce agent changes to screen readers
- Maintain keyboard navigation during transitions
- Ensure loading states are announced
- Preserve focus management

### Testing Standards
- Component tests: `src/components/chat/__tests__/`
- Use React Testing Library
- Test user interactions and state changes
- Mock API calls for context fetching
