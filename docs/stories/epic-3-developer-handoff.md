# Epic 3: Developer Handoff Package
## Professional Screenplay Editor with Enhanced UI Design Language

### Executive Summary

Transform Story-Drive from an "amateurish" purple gradient interface into a **professional creative writing platform** that seamlessly integrates AI agents with industry-standard screenplay editing. This is not just a UI refresh - it's establishing Story-Drive as the premier AI-assisted writing environment.

### 🎯 Design Vision

**From This:** Amateur purple gradient with floating cards
**To This:** Professional tool that rivals Final Draft + Notion + Discord

The new design embodies:
- **Professional authenticity** (industry-standard screenplay formatting)
- **Modern polish** (clean, sophisticated interface)
- **Seamless integration** (agents feel native, not bolted-on)
- **Performance first** (60fps animations, <100ms context updates)

### 🏗️ Implementation Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-3)
**Goal:** Establish the new visual system

1. **Import Design Tokens**
   ```css
   @import './public/styles/design-tokens.css';
   ```

2. **Implement Three-Panel Layout**
   - Grid-based layout: `[240px agents] [1fr editor] [360px chat]`
   - All panels must be resizable with drag handles
   - Smooth transitions using CSS variables

3. **Update Color System**
   - Remove ALL purple gradient backgrounds
   - Apply new surface/background colors
   - Implement agent persona color coding

4. **Typography Update**
   - Add Courier Prime for screenplay text
   - Apply Inter/SF Pro for UI elements
   - Maintain proper screenplay margins

#### Phase 2: Component Building (Days 4-6)
**Goal:** Build refined UI components

1. **Agent Panel Components**
   ```javascript
   // Key features to implement:
   - Compact 56px height cards
   - Search functionality at top
   - Selected state with 3px left border
   - Collapsible chat area below list
   - Online/offline status indicators
   ```

2. **Chat Panel Refinement**
   ```javascript
   // Key features:
   - Agent avatar + name in header
   - Context indicator ("Scene 3, Page 7")
   - Message bubbles with proper alignment
   - Quick suggestion chips
   - Auto-expanding textarea
   ```

3. **Smart Text Replacement**
   ```javascript
   // Implementation flow:
   1. Detect text selection in editor
   2. Show floating trigger button
   3. On click, expand to show agent suggestions
   4. Each suggestion shows agent icon + text
   5. Click to replace with smooth animation
   ```

#### Phase 3: Screenplay Editor (Days 7-9)
**Goal:** Professional screenplay formatting

1. **Format Implementation**
   - Scene headings: ALL CAPS, bold
   - Character names: Centered, ALL CAPS
   - Dialogue: 1" left margin, 3.5" max width
   - Parentheticals: 1.6" left margin
   - Action: Full width, normal case

2. **Format Indicators**
   - Left margin with S/A/C/D/P markers
   - Color-coded based on element type
   - Active indicator for current line

3. **Real-time Formatting**
   ```javascript
   // Auto-detect and apply formatting:
   if (line.match(/^(INT|EXT)\./)) applySceneFormat();
   if (line === line.toUpperCase()) applyCharacterFormat();
   // etc.
   ```

#### Phase 4: Interactions & Polish (Days 10-12)
**Goal:** Smooth, professional interactions

1. **Micro-animations**
   ```css
   /* All animations use these timings: */
   --duration-fast: 200ms;
   --ease-smooth: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
   ```

2. **Context Broadcasting**
   ```javascript
   // Throttled at 100ms
   const broadcast = throttle(() => {
     // Show pulse animation on agent avatars
     // Update context indicators
   }, 100);
   ```

3. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Tab between panels
   - Arrow keys in agent list
   - Escape to close/cancel
   - Enter to select/send

### 🎨 Critical Design Decisions

#### Why Remove Purple Gradient?
- Purple gradient reads as "amateur/playful"
- Clean whites/grays read as "professional tool"
- Accent color used sparingly for interaction states

#### Why Three-Panel Layout?
- Keeps everything in view (no context switching)
- Matches professional tools (IDEs, Slack, Discord)
- Allows simultaneous agent interaction while writing

#### Why Courier Font for Screenplay?
- Industry standard (Final Draft, WriterDuet)
- Writers expect this for screenplays
- Maintains proper page count calculations

### ⚡ Performance Requirements

**Non-negotiable Performance Metrics:**
- Panel resize: 60fps
- Context broadcast: <100ms latency
- Agent response: <2 seconds
- Text replacement: Instant (<50ms)
- Animation frame rate: Never below 60fps

**Implementation Tips:**
```javascript
// Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
// Use CSS transforms not position changes
// Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
// Throttle all continuous events (scroll, resize, mousemove)
```

### 🚀 Getting Started

#### Git Setup
1. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b epic-3/ui-enhancement`
   - Branch naming pattern: `epic-{number}/{feature-name}`
   - This keeps all Epic 3 work organized together
2. **Commit frequently** with descriptive messages:
   - `feat(ui): implement three-panel layout system`
   - `style(agent): add persona color coding to agent cards`
   - `perf(editor): optimize screenplay formatting performance`

#### Development Steps
1. **Review all design documents** in `/docs/architecture/`
2. **Import design tokens** from `/public/styles/design-tokens.css`
3. **Start with layout** - get three-panel structure working
4. **Build components** using specifications provided
5. **Add interactions** following animation guidelines
6. **Test thoroughly** against the quality checklist

### 💡 Pro Tips for Implementation

1. **Start with static mockup** - Get the look right before adding interactions
2. **Use CSS Grid** for the main layout - it's more flexible than flexbox here
3. **Component isolation** - Build each component in isolation first
4. **Progressive enhancement** - Get basics working, then add animations
5. **Test with real content** - Use actual screenplay text, not Lorem Ipsum

### 🧪 Testing Requirements

#### Browser Support Matrix
- **Chrome/Edge** (latest): Primary development target
- **Safari** (latest): Must support for Mac users
- **Firefox** (latest): Should support
- **Mobile Safari/Chrome**: Responsive design must work

#### Testing Checklist
```bash
# Before each commit:
npm run lint        # Check code style
npm run type-check  # Verify TypeScript types
npm run test        # Run unit tests

# Before PR:
- [ ] Test in Chrome, Safari, Firefox
- [ ] Test responsive breakpoints (use Chrome DevTools)
- [ ] Test with keyboard navigation only
- [ ] Test with screen reader (VoiceOver on Mac)

1. **Quick Revert** (if critical issues):
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>
   git push
   ```

2. **Feature Flag Approach** (recommended):
   ```javascript
   // Add to environment config
   const USE_NEW_UI = process.env.REACT_APP_NEW_UI === 'true';

   // Conditionally load design tokens
   if (USE_NEW_UI) {
     import('./public/styles/design-tokens.css');
   }
   ```

3. **Gradual Rollout**:
   - Deploy to staging first
   - Test with internal team for 24 hours
   - Deploy to 10% of users
   - Monitor for issues
   - Full deployment after 48 hours

### 🎯 Success Metrics
