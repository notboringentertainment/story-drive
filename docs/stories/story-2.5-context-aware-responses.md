# Story 2.5: Context-Aware Response Generation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As an** AI agent,
**I want** to naturally reference and build upon conversations from other agents (extending Story 1.4's document context),
**so that** users experience seamless continuity across the entire AI Writing Studio

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Agents acknowledge relevant context from other agents in responses
2. Context references are natural and conversational (not robotic)
3. Agent maintains its unique personality while incorporating context
4. System detects when to reference vs when to ignore other contexts
5. Cross-references include attribution (e.g., "as you discussed with Plot Architect")
6. Agents can build upon other agents' suggestions and ideas
7. Context integration doesn't overwhelm the current conversation
8. Response generation time remains under 3 seconds with context

## Dev Notes

### Prompt Template Structure
```
[AGENT IDENTITY]
You are the {agent_name}, specializing in {agent_specialty}.

[CONTEXT AWARENESS INSTRUCTIONS]
You have access to conversations from other agents in this session.
When relevant, naturally reference or build upon their insights.
Maintain your unique perspective while acknowledging others' contributions.

[DOCUMENT CONTEXT - from Story 1.4]
{document_context}  // Existing document context from ContextManager

[CONTEXT FROM OTHER AGENTS - from Story 2.3]
{injected_context}  // New cross-agent context from ContextInjector

[INTEGRATION GUIDELINES]
- Reference other agents like: "Building on what you explored with the Plot Architect..."
- Connect ideas naturally: "This character trait aligns with the theme you mentioned..."
- Maintain focus on current request while enriching with context

[CURRENT CONVERSATION]
{user_message}
```

### Attribution Phrase Variations
```javascript
const attributionPhrases = [
  "As you discussed with {agent}",
  "Building on {agent}'s suggestion",
  "Following up on your conversation with {agent}",
  "Expanding on what {agent} mentioned",
  "In line with {agent}'s insights",
  "Connecting to your work with {agent}"
];
```

### Context Relevance Scoring
```javascript
{
  directMention: 1.0,      // User explicitly references other conversation
  topicOverlap: 0.7,       // Strong topic correlation
  entityMatch: 0.6,        // Same characters/settings mentioned
  thematicLink: 0.4,       // Related themes or concepts
  generalContext: 0.2      // Broad relevance
}
// Threshold: 0.5 to include in response
```

### Response Examples

#### Good Context Integration
User: "How should my alien character speak?"
Agent: "Building on the first contact scenario you developed with the Plot Architect, your alien's speech patterns could reflect their unfamiliarity with human communication. Since you mentioned trust issues with the Character Psychologist, perhaps the alien uses formal, careful language to maintain distance..."

#### Poor Context Integration (to avoid)
User: "How should my alien character speak?"
Agent: "You talked to Plot Architect about space adventure and Character Psychologist about trust issues. For the alien character speech, considering the space adventure plot and trust issues..."

### Performance Benchmarks
- Context retrieval: < 200ms
- Context scoring: < 100ms
- Response generation: < 2500ms
- Total time: < 3000ms

### Testing Standards
- Integration tests: `server/agents/__tests__/`
- Response quality tests: Manual QA checklist
- Performance tests: Load testing with JMeter
- User acceptance testing: Beta user feedback
