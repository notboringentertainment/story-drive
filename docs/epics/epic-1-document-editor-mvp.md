# Epic 1: Document Editor MVP Integration - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Integrate a functional rich text document editor into the existing vanilla JavaScript STORY-DRIVE application, enabling writers to create and edit documents while consulting AI agents side-by-side without disrupting current functionality.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Working MVP with 8 specialized AI agents (Plot Architect, Character Psychologist, etc.) accessible through chat interface, team collaboration mode, real-time GPT-4 responses
- Technology stack: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Express.js backend, file-based storage (JSON/YAML), OpenAI GPT-4 API integration
- Integration points: Existing agent chat interface, Express API routes, file storage system, session management

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Adding TipTap rich text editor with side-by-side layout, auto-save functionality, and context passing to agents
- How it integrates: Editor injected into existing HTML structure, extends Express routes for document operations, shares existing agent communication channels
- Success criteria: Writers can create/edit documents while chatting with agents, zero disruption to existing agent functionality, <500ms performance impact

## Stories

1. **Story 1.1: TipTap Editor Integration** - Integrate TipTap editor into vanilla JS app with basic formatting toolbar and local storage persistence
2. **Story 1.2: Side-by-Side Layout Implementation** - Create responsive split-screen layout with draggable divider between editor and agent chat
3. **Story 1.3: Auto-Save Implementation** - Add automatic save functionality with version history and save status indicators
4. **Story 1.4: Context Passing to Agents** - Enable agents to receive document context for relevant advice

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (new routes added, old routes untouched)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (document storage added alongside existing)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (maintains current visual design language)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (<500ms page load increase, <50MB memory increase)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** TipTap integration conflicts with existing JavaScript or breaks agent chat
- **Mitigation:** Create isolated proof-of-concept first, use namespaced CSS, implement feature flag for gradual rollout
- **Rollback Plan:** Feature flag allows instant disable, document storage separate from agent data, can remove editor module without affecting core system

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing agent chat functionality verified through E2E testing
- [x] Integration points working correctly (agents receive context, saves work)
- [x] Documentation updated for editor usage
- [x] No regression in agent response times or quality
- [x] Performance metrics within acceptable ranges

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Approach
- Modular injection pattern to avoid disrupting existing code
- Separate `/editor` directory for all new code
- Event-driven communication between editor and agent systems
- Progressive enhancement strategy

### Key Dependencies
- TipTap v2.x (vanilla JS compatible build)
- LocalStorage for document persistence (Phase 1)
- Existing Express.js routes extended, not replaced

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for editor module (Jest)
- Integration tests for context passing
- E2E tests confirming agent chat still works
- Performance benchmarks before/after

### Deployment Approach
- Feature flag controlled rollout
- A/B testing with subset of users
- Monitoring for JavaScript errors
- Rollback plan documented and tested

## Sprint Planning

**Sprint 1 (Week 1):**
- Story 1.1: TipTap integration
- Story 1.2: Layout implementation

**Sprint 2 (Week 2):**
- Story 1.3: Auto-save
- Story 1.4: Context passing
- Integration testing and bug fixes

## Success Metrics

- Zero increase in agent chat error rate
- <500ms page load time increase
- 80% of test users successfully create and save a document
- No increase in support tickets related to agent functionality
- Positive feedback on editor usability

**Story Manager Handoff:**

Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running vanilla JavaScript, Express.js, with file-based storage
- Integration points: Existing agent chat UI, Express API routes, OpenAI API calls, file storage system
- Existing patterns to follow: Event-driven UI updates, JSON data structures, modular JavaScript organization
- Critical compatibility requirements: Must not break agent chat, maintain <2s agent response times, preserve all existing routes
- Each story must include verification that existing agent functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering a seamless document editing experience alongside AI agent consultation.
