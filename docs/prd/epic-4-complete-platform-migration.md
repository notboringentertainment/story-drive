# Epic 4: Complete Platform Migration

**Epic Goal**: Fully migrate all functionality to Next.js, deprecate vanilla JS system, and enhance with production features.

**Integration Requirements**: Ensure zero data loss, maintain all user features, and provide rollback capability.

## Story 4.1: Data Migration to PostgreSQL

As a developer,
I want to migrate all data to PostgreSQL,
so that we have a scalable database solution.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Schema supports all existing data types
2. Migration script handles all user data
3. Verification process confirms data integrity
4. Rollback script to restore file-based storage
5. Zero downtime during migration

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: All user documents accessible post-migration
- IV2: Query performance meets SLA requirements
- IV3: No data corruption or loss

## Story 4.2: GraphQL API Implementation

As a developer,
I want to use GraphQL for all API operations,
so that we have efficient data fetching.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. GraphQL schema covers all operations
2. Subscriptions for real-time updates
3. Backward compatibility with REST endpoints
4. Proper authentication and authorization
5. Query complexity limits enforced

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Legacy REST clients continue working
- IV2: No over-fetching or N+1 queries
- IV3: Response times improve or maintain

## Story 4.3: Complete UI Migration

As a user,
I want all features in the new interface,
so that I can stop using the old system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. All MVP features replicated in React
2. UI components match design system
3. Accessibility WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
4. Performance metrics meet targets
5. User acceptance testing passes

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Feature parity with vanilla JS version
- IV2: No regression in user workflows
- IV3: Performance equals or exceeds old system

## Story 4.4: Legacy System Deprecation

As a developer,
I want to safely deprecate the vanilla JS system,
so that we maintain single codebase.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. All users migrated to new system
2. Legacy code moved to archive
3. Dependencies updated and cleaned
4. Documentation updated
5. Monitoring confirms no legacy usage

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: No 404 errors from old URLs
- IV2: Proper redirects in place
- IV3: No orphaned data or resources
