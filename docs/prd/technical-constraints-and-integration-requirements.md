# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## Existing Technology Stack

**Current MVP Stack:**
- **Languages**: JavaScript (ES6), HTML5, CSS3
- **Frameworks**: Vanilla JavaScript, Express.js
- **Database**: File-based storage (JSON/YAML files)
- **Infrastructure**: Node.js runtime, likely single server deployment
- **External Dependencies**: OpenAI GPT-4 API, Basic HTTP server

**Target Production Stack:**
- **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Frameworks**: Next.js 14, React 18, NestJS, TipTap, Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (cache), S3 (documents)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers, Kubernetes, AWS/Vercel, CloudFlare CDN
- **External Dependencies**: OpenAI API, Anthropic Claude API, Stripe, Mixpanel

## Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**:
- Phase 1: Continue file-based storage with structured JSON for documents
- Phase 2: Set up PostgreSQL in parallel, implement dual-write pattern
- Phase 3-4: Migrate read operations to PostgreSQL, maintain file backup
- Phase 5: PostgreSQL primary with Redis cache layer

**API Integration Strategy**:
- Phase 1: Extend existing Express routes for document operations
- Phase 2: Implement GraphQL layer alongside REST
- Phase 3: Workflow engine uses GraphQL for agent orchestration
- Phase 4: Full GraphQL adoption with REST compatibility wrapper

**Frontend Integration Strategy**:
- Phase 1: Inject TipTap into existing vanilla JS with minimal changes
- Phase 2: Build Next.js app in `/next` subdirectory
- Phase 3: Feature flag to route users between old/new interfaces
- Phase 4: Complete migration to React components

**Testing Integration Strategy**:
- Phase 1: Add Jest for new document editor code
- Phase 2: Implement Cypress E2E tests for critical paths
- Phase 3: Unit tests for workflow engine (>90% coverage)
- Phase 4-5: Full test pyramid with integration and performance tests

## Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**:
- Phase 1: Add `/editor` directory in existing structure
- Phase 2+: Adopt Next.js App Router structure with domain-driven design
- Separate packages for agents, workflows, templates in monorepo
- Clear separation between legacy (`/legacy`) and new code

**Naming Conventions**:
- Components: PascalCase (DocumentEditor, AgentChat)
- Files: kebab-case (document-editor.tsx, agent-chat.tsx)
- API routes: RESTful naming (/api/documents, /api/agents)
- Database: snake_case (user_documents, agent_sessions)

**Coding Standards**:
- ESLint + Prettier configuration from Phase 2
- TypeScript strict mode for all new code
- React hooks and functional components only
- Comprehensive JSDoc comments for public APIs

**Documentation Standards**:
- README.md for each package/module
- OpenAPI specs for all REST endpoints
- GraphQL schema documentation
- Storybook for UI components (Phase 3+)

## Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**:
- Phase 1: Extend existing build scripts for editor bundle
- Phase 2: Separate build pipelines for legacy and Next.js
- Phase 3-4: Unified build with Turborepo/NX
- Phase 5: Optimized production builds with code splitting

**Deployment Strategy**:
- Phase 1: Deploy to existing infrastructure
- Phase 2: Blue-green deployment for Next.js app
- Phase 3-4: Canary releases with feature flags
- Phase 5: Full CI/CD with automated rollback

**Monitoring and Logging**:
- Phase 1: Basic console logging, error tracking
- Phase 2: Sentry integration for error monitoring
- Phase 3: Structured logging with Winston/Pino
- Phase 4-5: Full observability with Datadog/New Relic

**Configuration Management**:
- Environment variables for all secrets
- Feature flags via LaunchDarkly or similar
- Configuration as code in repository
- Separate configs for dev/staging/production

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- TipTap integration with vanilla JS may require significant refactoring
- Parallel system maintenance increases complexity
- Data migration could cause inconsistencies
- Performance degradation during transition

**Integration Risks**:
- Agent configurations might not port cleanly to new system
- User sessions across two systems could break
- API version conflicts during migration
- Database migration could corrupt data

**Deployment Risks**:
- Zero-downtime migration might not be achievable
- Rollback complexity increases with each phase
- Feature flag failures could expose incomplete features
- Cache inconsistencies during dual-write phase

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Build TipTap proof-of-concept before committing to Phase 1
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring from day 1
- Create automated migration scripts with rollback capability
- Maintain complete backup of all user data throughout transition
- Use shadow mode to test new system with production traffic
- Implement circuit breakers for all external dependencies
