# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**Phase 1: Document Editor MVP (Weeks 1-2)**
- FR1: The system shall integrate a rich text editor (TipTap or similar lightweight solution) into the existing vanilla JS interface without breaking current agent chat functionality
- FR2: The editor shall support basic formatting (bold, italic, headings, lists) and maintain formatting during save/load operations
- FR3: The system shall display the document editor and agent chat side-by-side in a responsive layout
- FR4: Auto-save shall trigger every 2 minutes and on significant user pauses (5+ seconds of inactivity)
- FR5: The editor shall maintain document context and pass relevant sections to agents when queried

**Phase 2: Architecture Foundation (Weeks 3-4)**
- FR6: The system shall establish a Next.js 14 application running in parallel to the existing MVP on a different port/subdomain
- FR7: The new architecture shall connect to the same OpenAI API and reuse existing agent configurations
- FR8: User sessions shall be shareable between old and new systems via shared authentication token
- FR9: The system shall implement a feature flag system to gradually migrate users from vanilla JS to Next.js

**Phase 3: Workflow Engine (Weeks 5-7)**
- FR10: The system shall parse and execute YAML-defined workflows with multi-step agent orchestration
- FR11: Workflows shall support agent handoffs with context preservation between steps
- FR12: The template system shall generate dynamic forms from YAML definitions with validation
- FR13: The system shall provide visual workflow progress indication during execution
- FR14: Elicitation flows shall pause for user input and present structured choices when required

**Phase 4: Complete Migration (Weeks 8-10)**
- FR15: All existing MVP features shall be fully replicated in the Next.js application
- FR16: The system shall migrate user data from file-based storage to PostgreSQL
- FR17: GraphQL API shall replace REST endpoints with backwards compatibility layer
- FR18: The document editor shall support real-time collaboration indicators (future multi-user prep)

**Phase 5: Scale & Polish (Weeks 11-12)**
- FR19: The system shall support 5,000 concurrent users with <2s response times
- FR20: Advanced formatting options (tables, code blocks, comments) shall be available in editor
- FR21: The system shall implement Redis caching for frequent agent responses
- FR22: Export functionality shall support DOCX, PDF, and Markdown formats

## Non-Functional Requirements

- NFR1: [Phase 1] Document editor must maintain <100ms keystroke-to-screen latency
- NFR2: [All Phases] Existing users must experience zero downtime during migration phases
- NFR3: [Phase 3] Workflow execution must complete within 10 seconds for standard templates
- NFR4: [Phase 4] Database queries must maintain <50ms response time at 1000 QPS
- NFR5: [Phase 5] System must maintain 99.9% uptime with automated failover
- NFR6: [All Phases] AI token usage must not exceed $15 per user per month through response caching
- NFR7: [Phase 2+] All new code must have >80% test coverage
- NFR8: [All Phases] UI must remain responsive on devices with 4GB RAM

## Compatibility Requirements

- CR1: Existing agent configurations and personas must work without modification in new system
- CR2: Current user accounts and project data must migrate seamlessly to new database
- CR3: UI must maintain familiar layout patterns to minimize user retraining
- CR4: API endpoints must support both old vanilla JS client and new Next.js client during transition
- CR5: Export formats must be compatible with standard writing tools (Word, Scrivener, Google Docs)
