# Epic 1: Document Editor MVP Integration

**Epic Goal**: Integrate a functional document editor into the existing vanilla JS application, enabling writers to create and edit documents while consulting AI agents side-by-side.

**Integration Requirements**: Must work within existing vanilla JS architecture without breaking current agent chat functionality. All changes must be additive, not destructive.

## Story 1.1: TipTap Editor Integration

As a developer,
I want to integrate TipTap editor into the vanilla JS application,
so that users can create and edit rich text documents.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. TipTap editor loads successfully in the existing vanilla JS environment
2. Basic formatting toolbar appears (bold, italic, headings, lists)
3. Editor content persists to local storage on every change
4. No conflicts with existing JavaScript libraries
5. Page load time increases by less than 500ms

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing agent chat continues to function without errors
- IV2: All current API calls still work correctly
- IV3: Memory usage increases by less than 50MB

## Story 1.2: Side-by-Side Layout Implementation

As a writer,
I want to see my document and agent chat side-by-side,
so that I can write while consulting AI agents.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Document editor takes 60% of screen width, agent chat takes 40%
2. Divider is draggable to adjust split ratio
3. Layout is responsive and stacks vertically on mobile
4. Both panels scroll independently
5. Layout preference persists across sessions

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Agent responses still appear correctly in chat panel
- IV2: No UI elements overlap or become inaccessible
- IV3: Performance remains smooth during simultaneous editing and chatting

## Story 1.3: Auto-Save Implementation

As a writer,
I want my work to be automatically saved,
so that I never lose progress.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Auto-save triggers every 2 minutes
2. Auto-save triggers after 5 seconds of inactivity
3. Save indicator shows "Saving..." and "Saved" states
4. Documents are saved to structured JSON format
5. Version history maintains last 10 saves

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Auto-save doesn't interfere with agent API calls
- IV2: File storage doesn't exceed allocated disk space
- IV3: Save operations complete in under 100ms

## Story 1.4: Context Passing to Agents

As a writer,
I want agents to understand what I'm writing,
so that their advice is relevant to my current work.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Current paragraph is automatically included in agent queries
2. User can select text to provide specific context
3. Document metadata (title, word count) is available to agents
4. Context limit is capped at 1000 tokens
5. Privacy mode to disable automatic context sharing

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Agent response quality maintains or improves
- IV2: API token usage stays within budget
- IV3: No sensitive data leaks in API calls
