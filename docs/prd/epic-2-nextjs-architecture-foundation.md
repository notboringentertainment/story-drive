# Epic 2: Next.js Architecture Foundation

**Epic Goal**: Establish a parallel Next.js application that can eventually replace the vanilla JS MVP, with shared data and authentication.

**Integration Requirements**: Must run alongside existing system without conflicts, share user sessions, and provide migration path.

## Story 2.1: Next.js Project Setup

As a developer,
I want to set up a Next.js 14 application structure,
so that we have a modern foundation for the platform.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Next.js 14 with App Router configured
2. TypeScript strict mode enabled
3. Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui components installed
4. Development server runs on port 3001 (avoiding conflict with existing 3000)
5. Basic routing structure matches existing application

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Can run simultaneously with vanilla JS app
- IV2: No port conflicts or resource contention
- IV3: Build process completes in under 2 minutes

## Story 2.2: Shared Authentication System

As a user,
I want to use the same login for both old and new systems,
so that I don't need multiple accounts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. JWT tokens are shared between both applications
2. Session storage uses shared Redis instance
3. Login on either system works on both
4. Logout affects both systems simultaneously
5. Token refresh handled transparently

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: No authentication loops or conflicts
- IV2: Session data remains consistent
- IV3: Security audit passes with no vulnerabilities

## Story 2.3: Agent Configuration Migration

As a developer,
I want to reuse existing agent configurations,
so that agent behavior remains consistent.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. YAML agent configs load in Next.js app
2. Agent personas maintain same characteristics
3. API integration uses shared OpenAI client
4. Response caching is shared between systems
5. Agent selection logic matches existing behavior

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Agent responses are identical between systems
- IV2: No duplicate API calls for same queries
- IV3: Configuration changes affect both systems

## Story 2.4: Feature Flag System

As a product manager,
I want to control which users see which system,
so that we can gradually migrate users.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Feature flags control system routing
2. Flags can be set per user, percentage, or group
3. Admin dashboard to manage flags
4. Automatic fallback if new system fails
5. A/B testing metrics captured

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Users see consistent experience based on flags
- IV2: No flickering between systems
- IV3: Metrics accurately track system usage
