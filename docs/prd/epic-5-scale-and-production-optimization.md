# Epic 5: Scale and Production Optimization

**Epic Goal**: Optimize the platform for 5,000+ concurrent users with production-grade reliability and performance.

**Integration Requirements**: Must maintain functionality while improving performance, implementing caching, and adding enterprise features.

## Story 5.1: Redis Cache Implementation

As a system,
I want to cache frequent operations,
so that performance scales with users.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Redis cache for agent responses
2. Session management in Redis
3. Cache invalidation strategies
4. Cache hit rate >80% for common queries
5. Failover to database if cache fails

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Cache doesn't serve stale data
- IV2: Memory usage stays within limits
- IV3: Performance improves by >50%

## Story 5.2: Performance Optimization

As a user,
I want fast response times,
so that writing flow isn't interrupted.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Page load time <2 seconds
2. Agent responses <2 seconds
3. Document saves <100ms
4. Search results <500ms
5. 60fps UI animations

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Optimizations don't break features
- IV2: Performance consistent across browsers
- IV3: Mobile performance acceptable

## Story 5.3: Advanced Export Features

As a writer,
I want to export in multiple formats,
so that I can use my work anywhere.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Export to DOCX with formatting
2. Export to PDF with styling
3. Export to Markdown
4. Export to Scrivener format
5. Batch export for multiple documents

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Exports maintain formatting accuracy
- IV2: Large documents export successfully
- IV3: Export files open correctly in target applications

## Story 5.4: Production Monitoring

As an operator,
I want comprehensive monitoring,
so that I can maintain system health.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Application performance monitoring
2. Error tracking and alerting
3. User analytics and behavior tracking
4. Cost monitoring for AI usage
5. Custom dashboards for key metrics

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Monitoring doesn't impact performance
- IV2: Alerts are actionable and accurate
- IV3: Data retention meets compliance requirements

## Story 5.5: Load Testing and Optimization

As a developer,
I want to verify scale capabilities,
so that we're ready for growth.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Load tests simulate 5,000 concurrent users
2. Identify and fix bottlenecks
3. Auto-scaling configured and tested
4. Database connection pooling optimized
5. CDN configured for static assets

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: System remains stable under load
- IV2: No data corruption during high load
- IV3: Graceful degradation when limits exceeded
