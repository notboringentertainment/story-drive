# Epic 3: Workflow Orchestration Engine

**Epic Goal**: Implement the declarative workflow engine that enables complex multi-agent collaborations through YAML-defined processes.

**Integration Requirements**: Must integrate with both existing and new agent systems, support state persistence, and handle long-running workflows.

## Story 3.1: YAML Workflow Parser

As a developer,
I want to parse YAML workflow definitions,
so that workflows can be declaratively defined.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Parse YAML files with workflow schema validation
2. Support triggers, inputs, agents, and steps sections
3. Validate agent references and dependencies
4. Error messages clearly indicate YAML issues
5. Hot reload workflows during development

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Invalid YAML doesn't crash the system
- IV2: Existing agent configs still work
- IV3: Parser completes in under 50ms for typical workflows

## Story 3.2: Workflow Execution Engine

As a system,
I want to execute workflow steps sequentially,
so that multi-agent processes can be orchestrated.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Execute steps in defined order
2. Pass outputs between steps as inputs
3. Handle agent handoffs with context
4. Support conditional step execution
5. Timeout handling for long-running steps

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Individual agent calls still work outside workflows
- IV2: System remains responsive during execution
- IV3: Memory usage scales linearly with workflow complexity

## Story 3.3: Template Processing System

As a writer,
I want to use templates for structured content,
so that I can create consistent documents.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Generate dynamic forms from YAML templates
2. Validate user inputs against template rules
3. Support repeating sections and conditionals
4. Variable interpolation throughout templates
5. Save partially completed templates

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Templates work in both old and new systems
- IV2: Form validation doesn't block valid inputs
- IV3: Template rendering completes in under 200ms

## Story 3.4: Elicitation Flow Handler

As a writer,
I want to provide input when the system needs it,
so that AI recommendations fit my vision.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Workflow pauses for user input when required
2. Present structured choices (1-9 options)
3. Support free-form text input
4. Resume workflow after input received
5. Skip elicitation in "batch" mode

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: UI remains responsive during elicitation
- IV2: User input correctly flows to next steps
- IV3: Abandoned elicitations timeout gracefully

## Story 3.5: Workflow Progress Visualization

As a writer,
I want to see workflow progress,
so that I understand what's happening.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Visual pipeline showing all steps
2. Current step highlighted in real-time
3. Completed steps show success/failure
4. Time estimates for remaining steps
5. Ability to cancel workflow execution

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Visualization updates don't impact performance
- IV2: Accurate representation of actual state
- IV3: Works correctly in both UI systems
