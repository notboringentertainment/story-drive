# BMad Master Epic 3 Recovery Summary

- Correct character positioning (2.2in)
- Single-line spacing (12pt)
- Auto-format on paste

## For Scrum Master

**Key Message**: Epic 3 was marked "Done" but was completely broken. Required complete rewrite, not minor fixes.

**Action Items**:
1. Review Epic 4 immediately for similar issues
2. Update Definition of Done to require integration testing
3. Implement BMad Master review before epic closure
4. Stop accepting UI-only deliverables

## Current Status

âœ… **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- All features working
- Memory persisting
- Context sharing active
- Industry-standard formatting
- Clean, professional interface

## Lesson Learned

*"A beautiful UI without backend integration is like a Ferrari without an engine - looks great, goes nowhere."*
